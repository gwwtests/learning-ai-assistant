## Request

Help me prepare concise , minimum words, maximum information, markdown files for implenentors/programmers, describing project (I guess "specs/REQUIREMENTS.md" "specs/SPECIFICAITON.md" ... probably something with project description? maybe folder with  example user stories/workflows?specs/stories? specs/workflows?)

I would like to start project small and simple and later grow...
project is to be learning-ai-assistant
that will be basically optimized set of workflows , and maybe in future agents, that assist person that is learning new topic, therefore: in maintaning and growing list of concepts (ontology), keeping track of curriculum (i.e. what person knows , and how well, and what needs to exercise), helps in managing track record of person learning and exercising materials (so we know what person read and check if knows it, and manage meta information which information from source materials is more and which less or not important), and the same with exercsises (including keeping track what skills or knowledge manifested thought exercises that student kwnows/masteres, and whichn makes mistakes.... ofc also using this to run files with statistics , so can keep track of... and help to suggest/design what to learn/exercisie next, for database/list of thnigs that require memorization, great if would help managing decks for Anki/Supermemo (integration), and source data from those apps to know progress... in general maintain organized knowledge about knowledge of app... also we may want to have directory in project to keep track record of work with Assistants like this that we do here together, so we can put record of this conversation so we can continue in future or be used in future... and in main directory specs/LAYOUT.md so Human/AI/LLM assistents know what should be where in repository and probably some file(s) with some guidelines how to work with repo to ensure consistency (and standards, e.g. that project is organized into small files that have tests , clear command line interface with -h|--help and -v|--verbose for debugging information (and the more -v parameters the more verbosity level e.g. -vvvv) etc... for consistency.
And some file to keep track in concice way what is done what not.
I mentioned many spearate files (mostly in specs directory), so hopefully README.md could remain very short and clean for potential end user, with references to other docs if needed...

## Assitant Reponse (chatgpt o1 as of 2025-01-09)

Below is an example minimal folder structure and a set of concise Markdown files. They focus on clarity, brevity, and a future-proof design so you can expand later. Feel free to rename, reorganize, or add details as your project grows.

# Learning AI Assistant

A modular assistant to help a user learn new topics, track knowledge, and suggest personalized study paths.

## Features
- Manage and grow topic lists (ontology).
- Track learning progress, materials, and exercises.
- Integrate with flashcard apps (Anki, SuperMemo) for spaced repetition.
- Suggest next learning or practice steps based on mastery.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies (see [REQUIREMENTS](./specs/REQUIREMENTS.md)).
2. Run `main.py -h` for command-line options.
3. Explore [SPECIFICATION](./specs/SPECIFICATION.md) for architecture details.

### **specs/REQUIREMENTS.md**

```markdown
# Requirements

## Environment
- Python 3.9+ recommended
- (Future) Node.js for front-end, if needed

## Dependencies
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) or [argparse] for CLI
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/) for web/API interactions
- [pytest](https://pytest.org/) for testing
- AnkiConnect or relevant library for Anki integration

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Adjust commands and dependencies as the project grows.)*
```

### **specs/SPECIFICATION.md**

```markdown
# Specification

## Overview
- **Goal**: Maintain a dynamic knowledge graph (ontology), track user learning progress, and suggest next steps.
- **Core Components**:
  - Concept manager (ontology).
  - Progress tracker (what user knows, mastery level).
  - Exercise manager (link skills/concepts to exercises).
  - Suggestion engine (what to learn/practice next).

## Architecture
- **CLI** entry point (e.g., `main.py`).
- **Modules**:
  - `concepts/`: handling concept storage, relationships.
  - `progress/`: tracking user knowledge, stats.
  - `exercises/`: storing/serving quizzes, tasks.
  - `suggestions/`: logic for next-step recommendations.

## Data Model
- **Concept**: {id, name, description, importanceLevel, prerequisites, ...}
- **ProgressRecord**: {userId, conceptId, masteryLevel, lastReviewed, ...}
- **Exercise**: {id, conceptId(s), question, solution, ...}

## CLI Standards
- `-h|--help`: usage info
- `-v|--verbose`: increase verbosity (`-vvvv` for max detail)
- `--version`: show app version

*(Expand details as needed.)*
```

---

### **specs/STORIES.md**

```markdown
# Stories

## Beginner Learner
1. **As a new user**, I want to add basic concepts, so I have a starting point.
2. **As a new user**, I want a recommended next step, so I know what to learn first.

## Intermediate Learner
1. **As a user**, I want to see which concepts I'm weak at, so I can practice them.
2. **As a user**, I want to review a curated exercise deck, so I can retain knowledge.

## Advanced Learner
1. **As a user**, I want advanced topics suggested, so I keep progressing.
2. **As a user**, I want auto-generated quizzes that adapt to my mastery level.

*(Add more stories based on new features or feedback.)*
```

---

### **specs/WORKFLOWS.md**

```markdown
# Workflows

## Adding Concepts
1. User enters `app add-concept "Concept Name" -v`.
2. App stores concept in ontology with timestamp.
3. User can link prerequisites via `--prereq <concept_id>`.

## Tracking Progress
1. User runs `app record-progress <concept_id> --score <0-100>`.
2. App updates mastery level, last reviewed date.
3. Suggestion engine recalculates recommended next concept.

## Generating Exercises
1. User runs `app generate-exercises --topic <topic_name>`.
2. App fetches relevant concepts and known difficulty.
3. App outputs a practice quiz or updates Anki deck.

## Reviewing Suggestions
1. User runs `app suggest-next`.
2. App checks user's mastery, time since last review.
3. Returns next concept or exercise to focus on.

*(Adjust or add new steps as features expand.)*
```

### **CONTRIBUTING.md** (root or in `docs/`)

```markdown
# Contributing

## Code Style & Organization
- Use small, focused modules. Each has corresponding tests.
- Follow consistent naming and docstrings.

## CLI Conventions
- Use `-h|--help` for usage info.
- Use `-v` up to four times for verbose debugging output.
- Include usage examples in each command.

## Pull Requests
- Reference related issues or tasks.
- Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting.
- Keep commits clean and well-described.

## Testing
- Use `pytest`.
- Place tests in `tests/` folder mirroring the code structure.

## Documentation Updates
- Update relevant `specs/*.md` files if your changes affect the design or workflow.
- Keep `README.md` end-user-friendly.
```

### Optional: **TODO / TRACKING.md**

```markdown
# Project Tracking

- [ ] **Initial ontology module** (in progress)
- [ ] **CLI integration** for concept adding/reviewing
- [ ] **Exercise manager** with basic question generation
- [ ] **Anki integration** for spaced repetition
- [ ] **Advanced suggestion engine** (future)
```

---

**Use these files as a starting point:**  
- Keep everything short, referencing deeper docs only when necessary.  
- Expand with more details as the project grows.  
- Maintain consistency with naming, file structure, and CLI patterns.
